# Social-Network-Ads-Purchase-Analysis
Developed a model to predict if a user will purchase products off social networks based on their age and salary. Models like Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, AdaBoost, KNN, XGBoost, SVC and XGBRF classifiers were compared.

The project includes analyzing data related to social network ads, identifying patterns and relationships, and building a predictive model to identify the target audience that is most likely to respond positively to the ads.
